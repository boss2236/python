🐍 Road to Python Level 100 🚀



This repo is my Python problem-solving grind — starting from the basics and aiming all the way to Level 100.
Every problem I solve gets uploaded here. Sometimes it’s a big batch of 5–6 problems, sometimes just 2–3 — but the uploads never stop.


📜 How This Works
Levels: Problems increase in difficulty as the levels go up.

Updates: I push new problems regularly — the repo is always growing.

End Goal: Hit Level 100 and create a massive library of Python challenges anyone can practice with.



🏆 Why I’m Doing This
Because you don’t master Python by only watching tutorials — you master it by solving real problems.
By the time I hit Level 100, I’ll have sharpened my problem-solving skills to the point where coding feels like second nature.
