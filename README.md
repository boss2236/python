This repo is my **Python problem-solving grind** — starting from the basics and aiming all the way to **Level 100**.
Every problem I solve gets uploaded here. Sometimes it’s a big batch of 5–6 problems, sometimes just 2–3 — but the uploads **never stop**.

## 📜 How This Works

* **Levels**: Problems increase in difficulty as the levels go up.
* **Updates**: I push new problems regularly — the repo is always growing.
* **End Goal**: Hit **Level 100** and create a massive library of Python challenges anyone can practice with.

## 🏆 Why I’m Doing This

Because you don’t master Python by *only* watching tutorials — you master it by **solving real problems**.
By the time I hit **Level 100**, I’ll have sharpened my problem-solving skills to the point where coding feels like second nature.

## 📈 My Rules

* Upload after every problem-solving session.
* Increase difficulty step-by-step.
* Never skip a level — every challenge matters.
* Keep it public so others can follow, practice, and improve.
